## HyperText Markup Language

HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as:

1.  < head> 
2.  < title>
3.  < body>
4.  < header>
5.  < footer>
6.  < article>
7.  < section>
8.  < p>
9.  < div>
10. < span>
11. < img>
12. < aside>
13. < audio>
14. < canvas>
15. < datalist>

and there are many others.
 
 ## How can it be used
An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".  The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the < title> tag can be written as < Title>, < TITLE>, or in any other way.

## What is semantic HTML :
Semantic HTML is the correct use of HTML to reinforce the meaning of content on a web page, rather than merely define its appearance. Semantically correct HTML helps search engines, screen readers, and other user devices determine the significance and context of web content.
