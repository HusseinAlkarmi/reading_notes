## HTML structure 

![htmlS](https://clearlydecoded.com/assets/images/posts/2017-09-11-basic-html-document-structure/thumbnail-750x400.png)

+ HTML pages are text documents.
+ HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
+ Tags are often referred to as elements.
+ Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
+ Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
+ Attributes require a name and a value.
+ To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

## What is HTML text?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.

## Text types

+ Headings and paragraphs
+ Bold, italic, emphasis
+ Structural and semantic markup

## mark up 
1. Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs
2. Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on

## What is CSS?
CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML) and the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.

+ CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.

+ Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

+ Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.

+ Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

+ CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

3. White Space: Javascript ignores multiple white spaces. 

4. Line Length and Line Breaks:

## javascript Decisions and Loops

 loops in JavaScript?

Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false
