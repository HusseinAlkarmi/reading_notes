![htmlS](https://clearlydecoded.com/assets/images/posts/2017-09-11-basic-html-document-structure/thumbnail-750x400.png)

+ HTML pages are text documents.
+ HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
+ Tags are often referred to as elements.
+ Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
+ Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
+ Attributes require a name and a value.
+ To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

## What is HTML text?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.

## mark up 
1. Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs
2. Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on
