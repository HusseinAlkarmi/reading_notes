## List 

1. Numbered lists
2. Bullet lists
3. Definition lists

![list](https://www.techfry.com/images/articles/html/html-lists.jpg)
+ Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
+ Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
+ Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.

1. CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
2. You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
3. You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
4. It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
5. Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
6. Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
7. CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

1. The name must begin with
a letter, dollar sign ($),or an
underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.

2. The name can contain letters,
numbers, dollar sign ($), or an
underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a
period (.) in a variable name.

3. You cannot use keywords or
reserved words. Keywords
are special words that tell the
interpreter to do something. For
example, var is a keyword used
to declare a variable. Reserved
words are ones that may be used
in a future version of JavaScript.

reserved words in JavaScript.

4. All variables are case sensitive,
so score and Score would be
different variable names, but
it is bad practice to create two
variables that have the same
name using different cases.

5. Use a name that describes the
kind of information that the
variable stores. For example,
fi rstName might be used to
store a person's first name,
l astNarne for their last name,
and age for their age.

6. If your variable name is made
up of more than one word, use a
capital letter for the first letter of
every word after the first word.
For example, f i rstName rather
than fi rstnarne (this is referred
to as camel case). You can also
use an underscore between each
word (you cannot use a dash).


## Switch:

### What is swith in JavaScript?

The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case , as well as statements in case s that follow the matching case .

### Why do we use switch statement?
We use a switch when you have at least 2 options to differentiate between, when the data type is usable for a switch and when all options have constant values. There are three good reasons. One, in most cases switch is faster than an if / else cascade. Two, it makes the intention of the code clearer
