### What are Hyperlinks?
In HTML, there are various forms of links. In images, there is the src attribute to "link" the source of an image.
For stylesheets, there is the link tag with the href attribute to "link" the source of a stylesheet.
For anchor tags, there is the href attribute to "link" the referenced section or page. Anchor links are also called hyperlinks.
When a user follows a hyperlink, they are navigating to that page. Hyperlinks are elements that reference another document, such that when a user clicks on that element, they are directed to the new document.
HTML Links - Syntax
The HTML < a > tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
< a href="url">link text< /a>
The most important attribute of the < a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.
Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

### HTML - Layouts
A webpage layout is very important to give better look to your website. It takes considerable time to design a website's layout with great look and feel.
Now-a-days, all modern websites are using CSS and JavaScript based framework to come up with responsive and dynamic websites but you can create a good layout using simple HTML tables or division tags in combination with other formatting tags.

In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.

### Accessing Object Methods
You access an object method with the following syntax:
objectName.methodName()
You will typically describe fullName() as a method of the person object, and fullName as a property.
The fullName property will execute (as a function) when it is invoked with ().

### Why pair program?
While learning to code, developers likely study several programming languages. Similar to a foreign language class, there are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful
Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to othersâ€™ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.
During a five-hour paired lab session, Code Fellows students work on all four of these language-specific skills. The abilities they foster will serve them well in completing assignments, in their own communication and learning, in interviews, and in readiness for a job at a company that utilizes this agile practice.

### Benefits:

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
