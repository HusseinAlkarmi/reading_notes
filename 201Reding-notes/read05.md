The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page. Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. ... The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag. The <img> tag has two required attributes: src - Specifies the path to the image.

## HTML Text
HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.
HTML Formatting Elements

### Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

1. < b > - Bold text
2. < strong > - Important text
3. < i > - Italic text
4. < em > - Emphasized text
5. < mark > - Marked text
6. < small > - Smaller text
7. < del > - Deleted text
8. < ins > - Inserted text
9. < sub > - Subscript text
10. < sup > - Superscript text

### HTML color names

Recent W3C specifications of color names distinguishes between basic and extended colors. In HTML and XHTML, colors can be used for text, background color, frame borders, tables, and individual table cells.

### JPEG, PNG, GIF

JPEG is a lossy compression specification that uses human perception. It can achieve a compression ratio of 1:10 without any noticeable quality difference. In addition, compression artifacts become more prominent. Because JPEG compression works by averaging the colors of nearby pixels (see Discrete Cosine Transform), JPEG images are best suited for photos and paintings of natural scenes with smooth color and intensity changes. However, if the image contains text or lines and requires strong contrast between adjacent pixels to highlight the correct shape, this lossy compression technique will not produce good results.

PNG is a lossless image format that uses DEFLATE compression. No data will be lost during the compression process and no compression artifacts will be introduced into the image. For this reason, PNG images will maintain higher quality and look sharper than JPEG images, and will also take up more disk space. This makes it unsuitable for storing or transferring high-resolution digital photos, but itâ€™s a great choice for images with sharp edges, text, logos, and shapes.

GIF is also a lossless image format that uses the LZW compression algorithm. In the early days, I was more favored by simple website graphics than PNG, because support for PNG continues to grow. Since all major devices now support PNG, and PNG compression is about 5 to 25 times faster than GIF compression, GIF images are now primarily used only when the image contains animation.
