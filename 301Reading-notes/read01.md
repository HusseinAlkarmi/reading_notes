A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. ... Components in React basically return a piece of JSX code that tells what should be rendered on the screen.

## Why are components useful in React?

Components are often described as “just functions” but in our view they need to be more than that to be useful. In React, components describe any composable behavior, and this includes rendering, lifecycle, and state. ... It is possible that those ideas might make it back into React too in some form. 

## Advantages of a Component-based Architecture

+ More Control and Lower Maintenance Costs. Say goodbye to searching for other applications where similar code might be used. 

+ Faster Development to Save Time and Increase Revenue.

+ Take Advantage of Specialized Skills.

Second: pass it to child components by using Props
Third: render the Props Data
