## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

+ Because it was not designed to be used like that. They we're design to communicate with a small group of machines.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

+ The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

## What does a GET do?

+ uses HTTP protocol to get the resources that are being referenced.

## What does a POST do?

+ POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. POST is one of the most common HTTP methods. Some other notes on POST requests: ... POST requests do not remain in the browser history.
