# Expressions and operators

## What are JavaScript expressions?
An expression is any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expressions that evaluates to a single value. The value may be a number, a string, or a logical value. Conceptually, there are two types of expressions: those that assign a value to a variable, and those that simply have a value.

|Name|	Shorthand operator|	Meaning|
|-------|-----|-----|
|Assignment|	x = y|	x = y|
|Addition assignment|	x += y|	x = x + y|
|Subtraction assignment	|x -= y	|x = x - y|

# Functions
## What is function in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want.

## Function declarations
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

The name of the function.
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

## Example
function square(number) {

  return number * number;

}

## Calling functions
Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.

Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters.
## Example,
 if you define the function square, you could call it as follows:

 square(5);

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur

## How do JavaScript functions work?
A function is a subprogram designed to perform a particular task. Values can be passed into functions and used within the function. Functions always return a value. In JavaScript, if no return value is specified, the function will return undefined.
